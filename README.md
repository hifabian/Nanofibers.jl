# Nanofibers.jl
These are simple scripts to generate 1, 2, or 3 dimensional electric and magnetic fields generated by an optical nanofiber.

This library is currently capable of generating the optical field on the outside of a tapered optical fiber with provided parameters for the fundamental HE11 mode and the HE21 mode.

If there is sufficient interest, possible extensions include:

- Generating the optical field on the interior of the fiber
- Generating field for higher order LP modes
- Creating official Julia package for similar projects

Please let me know if there is interest!

## Functionality

Currently, the library works by using the `generate_fields` command after setting the initial parameters in the `Param` struct.
